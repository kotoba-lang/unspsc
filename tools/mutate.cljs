(ns mutate
  "Prove the suite can fail.

  A test that has never gone red is a test nobody has measured. This applies
  one single-token mutation to one source file, runs `clojure -M:test`, and
  records which tests reddened — then restores the file. A mutation that
  reddens NOTHING is reported as a SURVIVOR, which is a finding about the
  suite, not about the mutation.

  Usage (from the repo root):

      nbb tools/mutate.cljs             # every mutation in the table
      nbb tools/mutate.cljs :duplicate  # one, by id

  The table lives in `tools/mutations.edn`. Each entry names the invariant,
  the file, an EXACT substring to find (it must occur exactly once — a
  mutation that matched a comment instead of the code would produce a red
  suite that proves nothing, which happened four times in this workspace on
  2026-08-13), and what to replace it with.

  ## Leaving a mutated file behind is the worst thing this tool can do

  Between `apply-mutation!` and `restore!` the working tree holds a source
  file that is deliberately WRONG. If the process dies in that window the
  repo is left mutated, with a `<file>.orig` beside it — and a tool whose
  whole job is to stop silent wrongness has just introduced some. It
  happened three times on this workstation on 2026-08-18 (twice in
  cloud-itonami-isco-4311, once in kotoba-lang/psa) when long runs were
  killed by `timeout`/SIGTERM under load ~240. Each was caught by a human
  noticing an unexpected entry in `git status`, which is luck, not a
  mechanism.

  There are two mechanisms here and they cover different failures. Neither
  is redundant with the other:

  1. RESTORE ON THE WAY OUT — a `finally` around the per-mutation body, plus
     SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP/uncaughtException/exit handlers that put the file
     back. This is BEST-EFFORT BY CONSTRUCTION. `kill -9`, a power cut, or
     an OOM kill run no user code at all, and nothing written here can
     change that.

  2. REFUSE TO START ON A STALE `.orig` — the backstop for exactly the case
     the handlers cannot cover. It converts a silent stranding into a loud
     one at the next run, which is the only guarantee available once the
     process can be destroyed without warning.

  ## Why a signal handler alone would not have been enough

  Measured, not assumed. `clojure -M:test` runs under `execSync`, which
  blocks the JS thread, and this whole script is synchronous top to bottom.
  A signal arriving mid-suite is queued by libuv but its JS callback CANNOT
  RUN until the stack unwinds to the event loop — which here never happens,
  because `-main` ends in `js/process.exit`. Registering the listener also
  removes Node's default \"die on SIGTERM\", so the naive fix has a nasty
  shape: SIGTERM'd mid-mutation, the run went on to finish normally and
  exited 0. The tree was clean, but `timeout` no longer stopped anything.

  So interruption is detected from the CHILD instead. When a signal is sent
  to the process group — which is what `timeout` does by default, and what
  Ctrl-C does — `clojure` dies with it, `execSync` throws, and the error
  carries `.signal`. A test run killed by a signal was not measured, so the
  harness restores and exits 128+signum rather than scoring it. That path
  is synchronous and needs no event loop.

  The listeners stay for the cases they do cover: a signal arriving while
  the loop is free (between mutations, during the fs writes), and `exit`,
  which fires on every `js/process.exit` in this file.

  When only THIS process is signalled and the child survives, restoration
  waits for that one suite to finish and the run then continues to the end.
  Slow, but it never strands a file."
