;; ## Why embed at all
;;
;; There is no portable `io/resource`. The obvious `:cljs` substitute —
;; reading `resources/<path>` relative to the PROCESS's working directory —
;; is right while this library is the root project and wrong the moment it is
;; a dependency. Measured 2026-08-18 in `kotoba-lang/technology`, which was
;; briefly written that way: `kotoba.iso3166`'s suite under nbb produced 159
;; errors, every one of them technology's registry coming back nil because
;; nbb's cwd was iso3166's root and not its own. This library exists to be
;; depended on by `cloud-itonami-unspsc-*`, so it would have inherited exactly
;; that fault.
;;
;; The EDN file stays the source of truth and the thing a human edits. The
;; generated namespace is a projection of it, checked by `--check`, and it is
;; what the library actually reads — no runtime file access, no cwd
;; assumption, and it works in a browser.
